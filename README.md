# CSV-Query

1. Clone/Download this repository
2. Put csv files in templates directory which we need to query from. (Due to some of the browser settings, while taking input of filename it doesn't take complete file path)
3. Create a virtual env of python3 or install the requirements on your system.
Run the app.py file on local server.
